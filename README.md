This is a quick and dirty conversion of **[DrLex0's make_fcp_x3g.pl](https://github.com/DrLex0/FFCP-GCodeSnippets)** Perl script to Python 3.

I've been playing around with Copilot and want to see how well I can use it to translate a Perl program into Python.

It's based on version 20211215 and currently doesn't support external postprocessiong scripts.
